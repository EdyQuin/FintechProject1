# Fintech Project 1
## Description

 + This project ("Project 1") is required for the UM BC class. Here, we will consider general food topics against other general food topics by chosen specific regions and attempt to measure which food topic is searched for the most on average within chosen specific regions. In order to further analyze the search measure of each general food topic we will then consider specific foods/dishes within those general food topics by region in an attempt to measure which specific foods/dishes within a general food topic in chosen specific regions is searched for the most on average. Like that we can analyze more closely each general food topic comparing specific foods/dishes within each general food topic by region. From a fintech perspective the results of the data laid out in different visualizations in Project 1 is aimed to be useful to eateries, caterers, grocerers, gastronomy entrepreneurs, etc. in different ways. For example, an eatery may consider such data for financial decisions related to budgets, ingredients orders, marketing/advertising, and its food menu.
